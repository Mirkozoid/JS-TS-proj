# 3D Model Generation Bot

This bot is designed to generate 3D models using Lumai AI Gen and deliver the results to users via Telegram.

## How It Works

1. The bot receives a prompt from a user on Telegram.
2. The bot then simulates a Discord user and sends this prompt to Lumai AI Gen.
3. Lumai AI Gen generates a 3D model based on the provided prompt.
4. Once the 3D model is generated, the bot retrieves the link to the model.
5. Finally, the bot sends this link back to the user on Telegram.

## Usage

To use this bot, simply send a message to the bot on Telegram. The message should contain the prompt for the 3D model you want to generate.

## Note

Please be aware that the generation process might take some time. The bot will send you the link as soon as the 3D model is ready.
