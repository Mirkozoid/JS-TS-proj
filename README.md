# Midjourney 6 Image Generation Bot

This bot is designed to generate images using Midjourney 6 and deliver the results to users via Telegram.

## How It Works

1. The bot receives a prompt from a user on Telegram.
2. The bot then simulates a Discord user and sends this prompt to Midjourney 6.
3. Midjourney 6 generates an image based on the provided prompt.
4. Once the image is generated, the bot retrieves the image.
5. Finally, the bot sends this image back to the user on Telegram.

## Usage

To use this bot, simply send a message to the bot on Telegram. The message should contain the prompt for the image you want to generate.

## Note

Please be aware that the generation process might take some time. The bot will send you the image as soon as it is ready.
